# Lines Drawer

#### A simple OpenGL program for drawing lines and dots (just lines with the same start and end) with different options:
- Drawing lines with different colors
- Drawing lines with different styles - simple line or stippled line
- Increasing/decreasing lines width
- Translating all drawn lines by X and Y
- Rotating all drawn lines clockwise and anticlockwise
